# top_js_rock_paper_scissors
Javascript rock paper scissors game for The Odin Project. Later iterations should have more of a front end to them.

This project helped me learn a lot of about variable scope. Using functions within functions, and a bit about for loops. 
It was also my first time getting user input in Javascript.
